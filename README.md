  # Practicing CRUD operations with NuxtJS and utilizing GraphQL APIs through a WordPress backend
![](https://github.com/chandra2607/blog-crud/blob/main/chrome_vBvU1jCv6s.gif)

This is a mini SPA demo web app created using Vue 3, Tailwind CSS, and WP-GraphQL. I have attempted to implement several functionalities that, while not optimal, serve well for learning purposes:
1. Listing blogs with pagination.
2. Authentication using JWT tokens.
3. Filtering posts by date and title text.
4. Adding a new post.
5. Creating a new post.
6. Including a random quote generator within one of the tabs.

This web app can aid in learning the following concepts:
1. Tailwind CSS.
2. Grids and Flexbox in CSS.
3. Making API calls using Axios.
4. State management in Vue 3 using ref.
5. GraphQL queries and mutations.
6. Pagination in GraphQL.
7. Emitting events and handling props in Vue 3.
